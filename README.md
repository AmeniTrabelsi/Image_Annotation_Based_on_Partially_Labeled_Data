# Image_Annotation_Based_on_Partially_Labeled_Data
Internship Report in the Multimedia Research Lab at University of Louisville

## Keywords:
Image annotation , Image Segmentation, Feature Extraction, Multiple Instance Learning, Bag of Features.

## Abstract:
Image Annotation based on partially labeled data consists in assigning labels to
new-to-the system images based on learning data in which the labels are bag-level
only. The image annotation in this work is both image-level and region-level. The
groundtruth data is only image-level labeled. The image annotation requires image
segmentation, feature extraction and Multiple Instance Learning Classification.
